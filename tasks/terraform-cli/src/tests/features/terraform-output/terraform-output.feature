    Scenario: output with no variables defined
        Given terraform exists
        And terraform command is "output"
        And running command "terraform output -json" returns successful result with no stdout
        When the terraform cli task is run

        And pipeline variable "TERRAFORM_LAST_EXITCODE" is set to "0" as output
        And no pipeline variables starting with "TF_OUT" are set

    Scenario: output with json flag defined
        Given terraform exists
